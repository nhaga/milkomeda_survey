It is not clear what their mission statement is and how that interface with [customers'] values.
It looks like they have too many irons in the fire - placating to treasuries/DAOs, rather than appealing to customers' desires with solutions to customers' problems.

What problem is Flint solving better than alternatives? - Why should a user be compelled to go through the inconvenience of migrating to Flint rather than one of the multiple alternatives?
What market demand is Milkomeda solving? - It doesn't look like there's a significant demand for bridging L1s (yet).

Dcspark seems to be a strong team, with extraordinarily competent builders. 
I would love to see this tremendous potential be directed towards a single problem, and absolutely crush it.",,5492621958228757904
